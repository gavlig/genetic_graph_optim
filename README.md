genetic_graph_optim
===================

University task.

Optimise graph every edge of which has length of 1. Input graph should always be connected.

Two kinds of optimisation:
1. Minimise average minimal distance between two vertices with constant edge quantity
2. Minimise edge quantity and average minimal distance for fixed graph depth
